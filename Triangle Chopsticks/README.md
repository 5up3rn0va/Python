Natsu and Grey are having a silly fight again and this time it’s about the person who is going to
have the larger piece of pie. So the guild master gives them a puzzle to solve and announces
that the winner gets the larger pie. There are 2 chopsticks with some given lengths ‘a’ and ‘b’
and a jar with chopsticks of different lengths. Grey is going to pick a random number ‘r’ and
Natsu is going to check if it is possible to make a triangle considering each chopstick from the
jar as the 3rd side and finds the total count of triangles that can be formed. If the no.of triangles
formed is more than the random number then Natsu is going to win. Else Grey wins. So find out
the winner. ‘n’ stands for the no.of test cases.

#### Input: ####
First line contains the no.of test cases n  
Second line contains a, b and r  
Third contains the no.of chopsticks in the jar (is always greater than r)  
Fourth line contains all the lengths of chopsticks in the jar  

#### Output: ####
In the first line give the total no.of triangles possible  
In the second line give the name of the winner
