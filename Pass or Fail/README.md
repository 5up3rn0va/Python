Make a program such that it takes input of marks (out of 100) of "n" subjects along with names
of "m" students. Then it should print the
names of all the students according to their ranks. The criteria for ranking is based on averages.
Also, the student who scored less than 40
in any of the subjects is not eligible for ranking and is considered "FAIL". Make sure to print the
list of students who failed in atleast
one of the subjects.
